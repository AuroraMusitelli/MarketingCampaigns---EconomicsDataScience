**ðŸ“„Machine Learning: Chatbot "MoodUp"**

Team project focusing on supervised learning and Word Embedding techniques for unstructured data analysis. The main goal was to develop a chatbot called 'MoodUp' that can recommend songs based on the mood expressed by users through three words entered. A dataset of song lyrics of different genres, published between 1950 and 2019. After using a Random Forest model to identify keywords in the lyrics, the most relevant songs were selected and a logistic model was built to interpret the results.

**ðŸ“„Times series: Energy consumption in the United States**

The project analyzes energy consumption in the United States from 1973 to 2024 using monthly data from the EIA. The goal is to study the evolution of the use of fossil and renewable energy sources, the effects of historical events on these consumption patterns, and the long-term relationship between the two types of energy sources in various sectors. Time series analysis (ARIMA, SARIMA, RegARIMA) allows for understanding trends and dynamics of the energy system.

**ðŸ“„Economics for Data Science: Digital Marketing Campaigns**

Team project focused on analyzing the effectiveness of three digital campaigns launched by Digimart, a rapidly growing Italian e-commerce company. Using causal analysis and self-organizing map techniques, we evaluated each campaignâ€™s impact on user engagement (clicks). The ultimate goal is to provide practical recommendations for optimizing the targeting, design, and distribution of future campaigns.
