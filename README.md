**ðŸ“„Chatbot creation "MoodUp"**

Team project focusing on supervised learning and Word Embedding techniques for unstructured data analysis. The main goal was to develop a chatbot called 'MoodUp' that can recommend songs based on the mood expressed by users through three words entered. A dataset of song lyrics of different genres, published between 1950 and 2019. After using a Random Forest model to identify keywords in the lyrics, the most relevant songs were selected and a logistic model was built to interpret the results.
